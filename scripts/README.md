# os.py/scripts
> This folder contains a bunch of useful os.py development scripts, and other tools which make developing os.py easier.

## Script description
> `add_license_information.py` - allows you to quickly add license information to all the project files,<br/>
> `print_all_functions.py` - allows you to print all functions from a certain code file, useful for os.py tests.

## Some other developer information
> The folders named `py.h_module` contain ports of current C code using <Python.h> library.
> The `py.h_module` code will be the future real code but I keep the normal code for tests as you can't run the <Python.h> code directly.
