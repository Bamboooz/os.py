## What is os.py?
> yeah uhh, so i work on this project everyday like I enjoy doing it but im like still learning don't expect it to work too soon. like it's not that much left but still yeah thank you for starring my project i guess

os.py exposes system and hardware information in a form of a python library. This allows you to write Python-based code to access low-level operating system and hardware data.

os.py allows retrieval of information such us: cpu, gpu information, statistics, supported features and sensors, ram and swap utilization and features, storage device information, external storage device information, machine peripherals and drivers and much more.

## Installation
### You can install os.py using pip:
```bash
pip install ospylib
```

## Usage
### Retrieving System Information
You can use os.py to retrieve system information, such as the firmware type, operating system version, and processor information.

```python
import ospylib

# Get the firmware type (BIOS or UEFI)
firmware_type = ospylib.firmware().type

# Get the operating system name
os_version = ospylib.system().name

# Get the processor model
processor_info = ospylib.cpu().model
```

### Reading system and hardware data from command prompt.
You can use os.py directly from the command prompt:

```bash
ospylib
```

You can also dump the os.py information into a text file:

```bash
ospylib --file {specify your filepath}
```

### And many more!
These were just random examples of os.py usage, but there's a lot more to explore, visit [os.py docs](https://github.com/Bamboooz/os.py/wiki) to learn about everything you can create with os.py.

## Roadmap
### Project launch state
> **os.py** launched in **May 2022**. As of **July 2023**, we are in the **Private ‚ùå** stage.<br/>

‚ùå **Private:** os.py is currently being developed, and you cannot install the library yet.<br/>
‚úÖ **Public:** os.py is ready for public use and is receiving regular updates.
