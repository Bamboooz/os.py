# Security Policy

The `os.py` project takes security very seriously. We strive to ensure that the code we produce is secure, and we encourage responsible disclosure of any vulnerabilities that are found.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in `os.py`, please report it to us as soon as possible by emailing me `bambusixmc@gmail.com`. Please include the following details in your report:

- A description of the vulnerability and the potential impact
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Any related logs, error messages, or screenshots
- Your contact information, including your name and email address

We will investigate all reported vulnerabilities and will respond to you as soon as possible with our findings and any necessary remediation steps.

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to investigate and, if necessary, release a patch or fix. We will work with you to ensure that the vulnerability is properly remediated and that our users are protected.

## Supported Versions

We strive to ensure that the latest version of `os.py` is secure and free from vulnerabilities. We recommend that you always use the latest version of the library to ensure that you have the most up-to-date security fixes.

We will provide security updates for the latest stable version of `os.py`. We may also provide security updates for older versions of the library on a case-by-case basis.
